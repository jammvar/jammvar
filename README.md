- Yo
- why are you reading this? I can't be that interesting. I only started this for attempts at amateur projects.
- I barely have experience in anything other than Java. So don't expect much.
- I'm a one man freakshow trying his best to be something better than boring.
- If you were ever actually interested... I'll probably forget to respond ngl.
